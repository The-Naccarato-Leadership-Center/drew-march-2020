            <p>What do Joe Montana, Michael Jordan, and Tiger Woods all have in common? They are all successful and they all have a coach! Having a coach will also help you achieve greater success. Specifically, a coach who is trained to identify and eliminate what is holding you back, capitalize on your strengths, and teach you the time-proven principles of success and prosperity.</p>
            <p>Dr. Naccarato is that coach. By using the time-proven principles of success and prosperity he will teach you how to keep your life in balance while building a low-stress, low-overhead, and high-profit practice full of patients who stay, pay, and refer.</p>
            <p>If you keep doing what you're doing, you will keep getting what you're getting. To get better results you need to change. Changing who you are and what you do can be incredibly difficult, but it becomes easier when you have someone to show you how. Dr. Naccarato is that person.</p>

            <h3>As a member of the Personal Coaching Program you get:</h3>
            
            <ul>
              <li>One-on-One coaching with Dr. Naccarato</li>
              <li>The First Two Weeks of Care seminar</li>
              <li>The Internal Marketing seminar</li>
              <li>The External Marketing seminar</li>
              <li>The program workbook: <i>Principle-Centered Practice Building</i></li>
              <li>The Jump Start Program</li>
              <li>The Quarterly Presentation Program</li>
              <li>Staff hiring, training, and management procedures</li>
              <li>Monthly packets that include a CD, newsletter, and tip</li>
              <li>Weekly email tip</li>
              <li>60 five to seven minute training videos on the Psychology of Success</li>
              <li>125 podcasts centered on the development of practice and personal growth</li>
              <li>6 full training videos (5 Critical Steps, Moral Authority, The Right Staff, The First Two Weeks of Care, Internal Marketing, External Marketing)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This program is not for everyone. It does not include fads, scripts, undignified marketing procedures, reduced fees, case fees, family discounts, or pre-pay agreements. These are poor attempts to incentivize patients into care and there will always be someone willing to offer a better deal. While they may work in the short term, they create huge practice building problems in the long run. The good news is that in this program you will build your practice on value, creating a thriving environment for both you and your patients!</p>

          <h3>Why Self Coaching?</h3>
      
          <p>With my emphasis on personal coaching, you may be asking yourself why the option of a self-coaching program? The truth is I can only handle so many doctors on my personal coaching program. However, I don't want you, your practice, or your family to suffer. The self-coaching program is so good, complete, and easy to implement that I am confident your practice will grow and improve significantly. The results of this program are success, prosperity, and a practice full of patients who stay, pay, and refer.</p>
    
          <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;"> <i>My experience has taught me that the only way to solve the problems chiropractors face is to understand and implement the integrity based, time-proven principles and procedures of success and prosperity taught in my personal and self-coaching programs.</i></p>

          <p><strong>So, here is my commitment to you;</strong> the self-coaching program will teach you how to build a low-stress, low overhead, high profit practice full of patients who stay, pay, and refer. By using dignified and integrity-based procedures, you will become a powerfully confident doctor capable of creating lasting success and prosperity while keeping your life in balance.</p>
